# RoguePy

RoguePy is a wrapper around the awesome libtcodpy library, and provides a powerful display layer, input handling, and a simple state machine for transitioning between different sections of your game.

The aim is to make things as intuitive as possible, while providing a fast interface for dealing with the mundane tasks of getting a  project off the ground.


##### RoguePy is currently in a pre-alpha state, and is not really ready for public consumption, but, please, feel free to mess around.

Documentation and a better feature set will be forthcoming.
