Decades after a devastating explosion rocked the mine in your small hometown, rumours have been spreading. Some of the old minors say the explosion wasn't an accident, that it was set deliberately by MineCorp to cover up a terrifying truth.

They say MineCorp got too greedy - dug too deep - in their search for the diamonds that were the cornerstone of their business.

The sole survivor of the catastrophy - an old recluse, these days, hardly seen by anyone - was said to speak of monsters in the depths of the mine. People around town speak in hushed tones of an even greater treasure guarded by the beasts in the deepest, darkest depths of the old mine.

Grabbing an old pick from the mining museum, and a handful of rock climbing supplies, you set out to reach the depths of the old mine, and determine once and for all the truth about the rumours.
