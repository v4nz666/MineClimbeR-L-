Decades after a devastating explosion rocked the mine in your small hometown, rumours have been spreading.
Folks say the explosion wasn't an accident, that it was set deliberately by MineCorp to cover up a terrifying truth.

They say MineCorp got too greedy - dug too deep - in their search for the diamonds found down below, and
unleashed  a terrible evil that lurks in the darkest depth of the mine.

The sole survivor of the catastrophe - an old recluse, these days, hardly seen by anyone - was said to speak
of monsters in the depths of the mine. People around town speak in hushed tones of a Great treasure
guarded by the beasts in the deepest, darkest depths of the old mine.

Grabbing an old pick from the mining museum, and a handful of rock climbing supplies, you set out to reach
the depths of the old mine, and determine once and for all the truth about the rumours.

## Getting started/Installation:

See the wiki for installation instructions (https://github.com/v4nz666/MineClimbeR-L-/wiki)

## Tips and tricks

- Your torch burns down in real-time, whether you've taken a turn, or not. This includes in the inventory/crafting menu. Don't dilly dally! You'll want to replenish your torch light, periodically, through the crafting menu (TAB).
- Be very careful digging down in any way (straight down, or diagonally). You're likely to fall to your death.
- Always clip in (space bar) before moving, if you don't know what's below your destination tile.
- Ranged attacks can help you keep a distance from your enemies, and can save you some much needed HP. Press the 0 key on the numpad to aim your bow (and again to cancel your shot), and the Enter key on the numpad to fire.
- Try to keep some metals in our inventory, you'll run out of anchors rather quickly. Craft some more with any single metal, from the crafting menu (TAB)
