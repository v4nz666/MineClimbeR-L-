Decades after a devastating explosion rocked the mine in your small hometown, rumours have been spreading.
Folks say the explosion wasn't an accident, that it was set deliberately by MineCorp to cover up a terrifying truth.

They say MineCorp got too greedy - dug too deep - in their search for the diamonds found down below, and
unleashed  a terrible evil that lurks in the darkest depth of the mine.

The sole survivor of the catastrophe - an old recluse, these days, hardly seen by anyone - was said to speak
of monsters in the depths of the mine. People around town speak in hushed tones of an even greater treasure
guarded by the beasts in the deepest, darkest depths of the old mine.

Grabbing an old pick from the mining museum, and a handful of rock climbing supplies, you set out to reach
the depths of the old mine, and determine once and for all the truth about the rumours.
